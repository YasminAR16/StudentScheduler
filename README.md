# StudentScheduler

A website will be developed that will create multiple mock schedules for students depending on the given criteria they give it. The criteria will be gathered from the following five categories: classes taken, current academic courses offered, major/core requirements, student’s interests, and student’s desired times to have classes. In addition, the categories will be ranked by the student to prioritize the criteria when creating the mock schedules. The algorithms used to create the possible mock schedules will be simulated annealing and bipartite matching.

Software to currently inform students on what classes they are missing and what classes are being offered/will be offered already exists with DegreeWorks and Xavier’s registration system. However, a system that combines the two to provide a mock-up schedule for students does not exist. This would aid students to have options before them that fit their needs when the time comes to register for classes. It would enforce the idea of needing to have particular courses to graduate but also take into account choices in interests and in desired class time.
